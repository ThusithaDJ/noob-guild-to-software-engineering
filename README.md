# [The Noob guilde to entering the Software Engineering industry.]()


Suppose you are a student or a person trying to get into tech(especially software engineering). In that case, this repo will help you find various resources to get started in tech. I'll try to keep this repo up to date as much as possible. However, if you need any additional resources which I haven't added to this repo, please create an issue in this repo and write down your request. I'll review it and try to resolve the request in a timely manner.
